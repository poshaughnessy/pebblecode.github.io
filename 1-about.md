## Some History

We have been around since early 2010, building software for startups, investment funds, gaming companies &amp; enterprises across many industries. pebble {code} was born out of its sister company <a href="http://pebbleit.com">pebble.it</a> (who provides creative IT support &amp; solutions) with which we still share an office, an ethos and a social life.

We believe in employee empowerment and development, only working on work that excites us and that unnecessary management layers are, well, unnecessary.

pebble {code} has a great product and luckily a huge market of juicy problems to get stuck into. We are growing too and with this growth comes ever increasing resources to continually improve... and it is exciting!
